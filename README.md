# Lexical-Analyser
A lightweight Lexical Analyzer in C that reads a C source file and converts it into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, numeric and float constants, operators, symbols, string literals, and character constants. Ideal for learning compiler design, understanding tokenization, and use in mini-projects or academic submissions.
